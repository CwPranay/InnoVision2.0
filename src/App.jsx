  CONTENT CREATING RULES 
1. Know Your Audience
   - Understand what resonates with your target demographic. Tailor your content to their preferences, interests, and behaviors.

2. Grab Attention Early
   - The first 3-5 seconds should captivate viewers. Start with a hook, whether it’s a visual, intriguing question, or bold statement.

3. Keep It Short & Sweet
   - While Reels can go up to 90 seconds, shorter content (15-30 seconds) tends to perform better. Aim to deliver value quickly.

4. Make it Visually Engaging
   - Use high-quality visuals, good lighting, and appealing colors. Aesthetic quality matters, but creativity is key.
   - Use fast cuts or transitions to keep things dynamic.

5. Use Trending Sounds/Music
   - Leverage popular songs or audio clips to increase visibility. Platforms like Instagram prioritize trending sounds in their algorithm.
   - Sync your content to the beat or use sounds that complement your message.

6. Tell a Story
   - Even in short videos, narrative structure matters. Ensure there’s a clear beginning, middle, and end.
   - You can either follow a linear structure or use a twist at the end to surprise the viewer.

7. Add Captions/Text
   - Not everyone watches with sound on, so adding captions ensures your message reaches a wider audience. It also helps with accessibility.
   - Keep text minimal and legible, but engaging.

8. Encourage Engagement
   - Use clear calls to action (CTAs) like “comment below,” “share this,” or “follow for more.”
   - Ask questions or prompt viewers to engage with your content in the comments or via polls.

9. Be Authentic
   - Authenticity is highly valued by audiences. Be yourself or showcase genuine moments.
   - Behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, or relatable content often resonate well.

10. Experiment with Formats
   - Mix up content styles: tutorials, tips, challenges, storytelling, reactions, etc.
   - Use different features such as text overlays, stickers, effects, and transitions to keep things fresh.`},
